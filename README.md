===========================

A question and answer application where users can pose questions in a variety of topics to be answered by other members. 

Yodelit was created through a series of events beginning with the idea of a logo. We wanted an animal mascot that we could use in our logo. Also, we wanted to have a catchy name (such as Twitter-Tweets) where the names of the Question/Answer were catchy and would reference the application, not just a simple question/answer. In searching for the animal mascot, a video of screaming goats came around, which natually lead to mountain goats and a mountain range. Of course, what does one do on a mountain? Yodel. Yodelit was born.
